# A(ng)ularm Clock

A digital alarm clock emulator created with Angular 7, functionality includes setting manual time, retrieving the current time automatically and setting up an alarm to beep when the time matches.

This project focused on clean UI design with minimalistic feel and a complimentary color scheme.

## Lessons Learned
- Angular 7: components, databinding
- CSS FlexBox and box shadows
- TypeScript syntax
- Emmitting events

## Live Demo

## ToDo
- Alarm sound plays locally but not on production (GitHub pages), need to fix this
- Devices smaller that 400px (width of time display) cuts off may need to add media queries
