# A(ng)ularm Clock

A digital alarm clock emulator created with Angular 7, functionality includes setting manual time, retrieving the current time automatically and setting up an alarm to beep when the time matches.

Time logic has been implemented manually with a single setInterval that increments only the seconds.

This project focused on clean UI design with minimalistic feel and a complimentary color scheme.
